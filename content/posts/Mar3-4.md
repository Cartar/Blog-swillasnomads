# Post 9: Utah Rocks!

Though I do hope some people enjoy reading these (often long) blog posts, I will try and keep this one short and encourage everyone to go watch the video Will (will) compiled. It gives a much better idea of the beauty and thrill of these parks. Especially given that describing these trails in words is beyond my artistic ability. 

### Zion National Park

&nbsp;

This park should be on everyone’s bucket list. It has the most exceptional views throughout the park and multiple hikes for all skill level. Though the park is gaining in popularity (says the park ranger), and so Will and I would both recommend you go over a shoulder season. First off the weather will be cooler and secondly you will avoid some massive crowds (over 4.4M people visited in 2019). 


We were so early in their shoulder season that shuttles didn’t even run, so we were forced to rent bikes in order to get to our hiking trail. Though it quickly became apparent to us that biking was the way to go. Yes the bikes sucked, and yes it was uphill for a few miles, and it took us an hour to go half way through the park, but the 360 views you experience are unparalleled.

#### The hike we chose: Angel’s landing

We talk a lot about this hike in the video, and as mentioned above the video really does give you a better sense of this hike but I still need to touch on it a little bit. Angel’s landing was the most gripping (pun intended) hike I have ever done. The trail was cut into rock in 1926 (going on 100 years!), and you can see the multiple holes that have been used over time to hold the metal poles that hold the chain. If you can stomach heights, and are sure-footed, this trail is a must. You are greeted by incredible views throughout the climb and the scramble to the top is really unique.

### Bryce Canyon National Park 

Thank you Eric for this recommendation. The park is a must see and unlike Zion, I believe it can be thoroughly done in 1 day.

#### The hike we chose: Navajo trail into Peek-A-Boo loop

&nbsp;

Though we didn’t do all the trails, we would recommend everyone do this one. It loops around a large section of the Bryce amphitheater, the area of the park for which it is best known given it has the most unique grouping of hoodoos.

> Google describes a Hoodoo as: a tall, thin spire of rock that protrudes from the bottom of an arid drainage basin or badland (also called a tent rock, fairy chimney, or earth pyramid).

&nbsp;

The hike is rated difficult, but after scaling rocks in Zion, this hike felt pretty mild (at least in a fear for my life kind of way). I did still struggle to breathe properly as we hiked, which I attributed to the altitude, especially after having spent over a week at sea level in California.

#### Recommendation: 
* If you are planning to visit these parks we would recommend starting with Bryce Canyon and then spending like 3 days in Zion. There are so many beautiful hikes to do, and it is not possible to cover the park in one day.
