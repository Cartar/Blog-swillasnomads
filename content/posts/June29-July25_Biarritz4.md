## Post 25: Biarritz, A Reflection 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/will_balcony.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

This post will be slightly different. Since Will and I weren’t gallavanting the world over the last month and instead were fully embracing a retired lifestyle we have less to report on an activity basis and more to discuss in terms of conclusions (we had lots of time to reflect). 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/blogging.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Having two months in one location with no job was a new experience. One we’re so happy we had, it spurred new thoughts and realizations. June was characterized by exploring and settling in, marked by friends and family visits and swallowing lots of salt water. July was about repetition, surfing improvements, embracing retirement and swallowing more salt water.

&nbsp;

The post will be comprised of surfing observations, Biarritz observations and finally personal takeaways.  

### Surfing Observations

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/biarritz_house.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

With less tourist type activities we threw ourselves at surfing. We were at some points nursing injuries, but when we could surf we did. Our schedule thus revolved around low tide (which shifts by about ~50min a day). We experienced large surfing improvements in July. The extra 10 days we booked at a different airbnb to extend our stay was so important in that regard. Overall we surfed about 30 days each over the 8 weeks. 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/selfie_surf.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Mid july was a turning point. Along with Bastille Day (France’s Canada Day), and way more tourists, the 6 week point marked a change in our surfing, we were getting up more regularly, surfing bigger waves and not weakening as quickly (i.e. we had built up the proper surfing muscles). 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/fireworks.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

With all the time thinking about, observing and doing the surfing we had some observations: 
- Surfing is incredibly meditative in any weather (rain or shine). We could have been thinking about the biggest life decisions, but as soon as you step into the water your focus immediately goes to the ocean. What do the waves look like today? How strong is the current? Where should I be placing myself? And on and on. It was the perfect mental flow state. 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/last_surf_day.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

- There is immense confidence growth in learning something new. When I first went out to surf in early June, I was nervous taking up room amongst the other surfers, not feeling like I belonged and not wanting to make a fool of myself. But until you can embrace that uncomfortability there is a limit to your learning. Once you face it and nothing horrible happens, you grow.

&nbsp;

- Buying boards was definitely the right call for us, especially because we were able to recover half the cost when we sold them before leaving. Buying allowed us to get very familiar with our boards and build up comfortability. Not to mention the ease of heading out whenever we wanted without stopping by a shop. 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/will_board_kiss.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

- Tactical point; learning to read the surf report of your area is so key. What wind direction are you looking for? When is the surf at it’s best for your level? Over 2 months we saw such a large variety of conditions out at the same beach. This fact makes surfing one of the most challenging sports I have ever attempted. The variability is massive. But part of why July went so much better than June was that we knew when to go out into the water to give ourselves the best chance at success.

### Biarritz Observations

This beautiful town with its history of monarchic/aristocratic tourism blended with a surge of surfing culture in the 60s leaves such a unique envornment behind. Will and I have vowed to come back. 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/castle.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

- Two months in one place allows for deeper connections - with place and routine. The luxury of time provides space for the joys in the little things (cooking, swimming, reading, walking, writing, just standing still for a little bit).

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/sam_reading.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

- When you’re in a location longer than 2 weeks, we found, you start setting up a routine. Ours looked something like: surf around low tide, make 3 meals a day, fit in some yoga and french time for Will, complete some errands, read/journal and watch a french show at night with some mint tea. 
    - However, it’s important to leave room for deviations from the new routine (date nights, adventures, ect). These deviations help mark time, slow things down and potentially spur new thoughts. 
    - Our examples of deviations: 
        - Night out - dinner at Helbidea 
        {{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/new_hair.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
        - Saint Jean de Luz round 3 in the heat. It was so hot we had to leave our appartment and what better way to spend the day then in AC’ed buses going to and from our favourite beach. We spent our time going from the water to the shade. It was honestly lovely.  
        {{< carousel title="" >}}
&nbsp;
        - We pushed ourselves to surf in a new location (La Côte Basque as opposed to our normal spot - La Grande Plage). It was a further walk but we’re so happy we tried something new. 
        {{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/cote_basque.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
        - Spending a few of our euros on drinks at my favourite bar (Extola Bibi)
        {{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/bibi.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
        - Meals & drinks in the shade by the ocean. 
        {{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/july1.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
        - Celebrating Will’s birthday! 
            - Hitting up the Casino to lose money on roulette! 
            - And having our favourite wine at the best restaurant in town - Le O2 Verdun. 
            {{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/O2.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
- Transitioning out of a really good place (our first airbnb) into a slightly less good place makes leaving the city much easier. 
{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/kitchen_new_place.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
- A/C is a magical invention, but cold water and fans help in a pinch. Though even after 2 months of heat, and sleeping in over 25 degrees at night, Will and I are not acclimatized. 
- For all the wonders that is Biarritz, there is dog poo everywhere! People really do not pick up after their pets. 
- Black isn’t a colour you see very often in Biarritz, probably to avoid the sun, but I think both Will and I delved into how much we love wearing colours. It brightens up our day. 
- Baguette’s for every meal is encouraged. But more seriously, if you can’t make your normal food in another country, get meal inspiration at the grocery store (we were happy to discover basque style chicken and canned cassoulet).

### Personal Takeaways

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/will_balcony_breaky.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

You don’t spend 2 months in a new environment without contemplating how it has affected you and what you've learnt. Here are our main takeaways we don’t want to forget: 
- It’s engaging to learn a new skill (surfing, french for Will), obviously a drive to want to learn the skill is quite important. 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/sam_board.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

- We must remember to be wary of moving goal posts (a good piece of advice for life, but also for smaller time bound experiences such as a sabbatical goal, like surfing) 
    - It’s okay to move on to a new goal when the last one is achieved but take time in savouring the accomplishments. 
    - E.g. we’d been working for weeks to get up more consistently on our boards, and once we did we had to remind oursevles not to be disappointed that we weren’t making turns or not getting up on bigger waves. We had to remember where we had started.
    {{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/feet.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
- We both experienced such a large feeling of contentedness / pride in accomplishing a life goal (i.e the sabbatical, Biarritz was the last piece we had been talking about for 5 years, the month of August is all just cherries on top). The pride and general joy we’ve felt from experiencing our sabbatical goals has us planning to plan another one. 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/thumbs_up.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
- That much time away from our usual environment gave us space to invest our time anywhere we wanted (duh, but a fun observation nonetheless). 

{{< figure src="/img/June29-July26/will_on_phone.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
- You will encounter stress and bad times no matter the planning or perfection of location (like injuries, bad weather, transportation problems) - how you react is all you can really control. Here I thought external factors from a working life led to stress, and some of it was true but a lot of that stress followed me into the sabbatical. It’s been a helpful thing to be aware that I’m the common denominator - and maybe I should do something about it.
