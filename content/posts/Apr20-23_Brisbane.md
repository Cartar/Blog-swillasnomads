## Post 13: Maria and Koalas 

After spending 4 days in Brisbane, Will and I concluded that Maria was right. Brisbane is a fantastic city to live in but could probably be done in 1 day if you didn’t know anyone in the city. However, Will and I were lucky enough to know a local who showed us the best time and allowed us to crash in her one bedroom apartment. We owe you one, Maria.

Our first day was a warm one. Temperatures hit the high 20s and we set out, with our bucket hats, for a beach day along the Gold Coast.

&nbsp;

Even though you’ll soon hear of how many Australian animals we got to see, this beach day was my favourite.

&nbsp;

We mixed in a coastal walk with a view before settling on the beach for a few hours, thank goodness Maria had a parasol to shade our Canadian winter skin from the sun (UV was like a 7 - silly hole in the ozone). We played in the waves, threw a frisbee and learned a new lawn game, Finska, but weren’t good enough to beat Maria (better her than Will, I always say).

If you are to hit up Brisbane on your own Australian trip, we would highly recommend Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. It was lovely. And especially special to see so many animals I had never seen in person before, from Koalas, to Kangaroos, all the way to Platypuses and Tasmanian Devils.

We spent a good amount of time just staring at the baby koalas eating their eucalyptus.

&nbsp;

Beyond the animals, a real bonus of being with a local was being introduced to all her friends and being invited to tag along. We crashed a group BBQs (most parks in Brisbane had public BBQs available for anyone to use, the city took care of cleaning them every night!), a mini golf bar hang, burgers at Betty’s and drinks at Felons (as far as we’re concerned the only watering hole worth a visit in Brisbane).

#### Recommendations 
* **Felons** - it is a massive institution with the largest patio I’ve ever seen along the city’s water

&nbsp;
* **Betty’s Burgers** - Will’s favourite 
{{< figure src="/img/Apr20-23/bettys.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
* **Lone Pine** - Koala Sanctuary
{{< figure src="/img/Apr20-23/sleeping_koala.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
* **Cheeky Poke Bar** - You can make your own, or get one of theirs
{{< figure src="/img/Apr20-23/poke.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
* **Messina** - The absolute best ice cream I’ve ever had. The pistachio praline was out of this world. 
{{< figure src="/img/Apr20-23/messina.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;
* **Holey Moley Golf Club** - a great way to spend an evening, the mini put course is as creative as their cocktails
