# Post 3: Family in Fernie

Next stop on this cross Canada skiing journey was Fernie, BC. This small town of roughly 5 thousand people in the summer which doubles in the winter is home to my cousin, Penelope, her husband Mat and their son, my first cousin once removed (a mouthful, I know), Nolan. It is also home to a beautiful ski resort which thankfully for me, offers a wider range of terrain compared to Kicking Horse and so more ways to ease myself into west coast black diamonds. 

#### **TLDR:**
Fernie should be on everyone‚Äôs skiing destination list, the ski hill offers lots of stimulating terrain as well as really challenging cross country skiing routes (details below) and the town itself is really lovely to walk around in. Our time in Fernie was made particularly special given that I got to spend it with family I‚Äôve only had the pleasure of seeing a handful of times in my life. We spent a lot of time outside, eating amazing food, utilizing the hot tub for our sore muscles and playing Catan with Nolan.

We had such an action packed week, that I‚Äôll break it down by day so that Will and I can look back on our time in Fernie with great detail. 

#### January 18th: First Ski Day in Fernie

Will and I spent our first full day in Fernie skiing. It was a short day for myself as my boots were causing me lots of pain that needed to get addressed at a ski shop in town, but meanwhile Will took the opportunity to get a guided tour of the mountain, finding his favourite runs. Unfortunately for us, due to the unseasonably warm temperatures across the west the week prior, the mountain was mostly covered in ice. It weirdly felt like home (i.e. east coast skiing), Will felt particularly fine skiing the ice he termed as ‚Äògrippy‚Äô (I have yet to feel that ice is grippy). 

That night, after some flight difficulty, my parents arrived from Ottawa to join the festivities in Fernie. We had delicious vermicelli bowls for dinner and prepared ourselves for a full day of skiing the next day with my dad, on his birthday. My mom would stay back and join us on Friday with the rest of the family after Fernie hopefully would receive some snow.

#### January 19th: Dad‚Äôs Birthday

The 19th was our first full full day of skiing - i.e. from open until last lift. It was a beautiful blue bird day. We found a run we enjoyed and lapped it in the morning before venturing off into different terrain. I rode a T-Bar for the first time and had to be told not to sit on it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and we had delicious fries for lunch (thanks Dad!).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

And since the day was so beautiful we had to stop for a pitcher of beer at the Lost Boys lodge at the top of the mountain, and yes I said we, I was forced to also drink some beer, in honour of my father's bday, and yes, I regret it.

&nbsp;


The day was warmly concluded with a soak in the hottub where Nolan peer pressured almost everyone into jumping in the snow at some point or another, where we repeatedly saw how hard packed the snow really was. Needless to say, my dad‚Äôs snow angel didn‚Äôt really come out. We concluded the day with a stop at the Fernie Brewery (Do you see a trend emerging in our pit stops yet?). It was an activity filled day.

#### January 20th: Extreme Cross Country Skiing - a story

After a very relaxing Thursday morning, we (the parents, Will and I) decided we had to get outside. And what better way to do that than with another winter sport, cross country skiing. Now, most people will be somewhat familiar with this sport. Your toes are strapped into very narrow skis, leaving your foot the ability to lift up as you push yourself forward through normally, well defined tracks. And this was the sport we thought we were signing up for. Though we were partially warned: 

> The guy Will rented his size 14 shoes from saying ‚ÄúOh you‚Äôre doing the trails up by the mountain, there is a huge uphill, but don‚Äôt be discouraged.‚Äù & ‚ÄúComing down the hill is so much fun!‚Äù

Obviously little research went into this adventure. We showed up at the Fernie resort, rented our equipment, drove to the trailhead and at first the trail was slightly downhill and we‚Äôre all speeding past each other, laughing, trying not to fall. It was all fun and games until we turned the corner and saw the beginning of what I can only describe as the end. A very steep uphill section that NEVER ended. Some might think I am being dramatic, and I will never be able to prove you wrong until you attempt this trail for yourself. 

We had to side step our way up the mountain (and it was a mountain, we were climbing the base of the ski hill). This went on for a long time, we stopped to drink water, take off multiple layers, complain, laugh, and keep going. When we finally got to the top after what I can only assume was 30mins, we hit the beginning of the loop we had come to do. 

My mom and I were quite tired at this point, and decided to head in for 15min and turn back. At which point, our party of 4 split into 2 groups. My mom and I, and Will and my Dad. 

*This is where disaster really struck.* 

That very large hill we had climbed on the way up, was now a very steep slope with the skinniest skies I have ever worn and no good way to stop. The pizza became our main tool of descent, and when that failed, there was falling. I personally threw myself backwards 3 times on the way down to stop myself. My mom fell once. 

And what we learned after the fact was that Will also fell. However Will hadn‚Äôt been using the pizza from the get go. Being an alpine ski racer as a kid made him comfortable with speed (you know where this is going). He obviously wasn‚Äôt used to cross country skis on what can only be described as alpine terrain, and so Will took a large fall on his way down. What was lovingly described by my dad as a ‚Äúwipe out‚Äù. Unfortunately, once the adrenaline had worn off, Will realized he had hurt his wrist quite badly, and so would be missing the next ski day to rest it, and hope it didn‚Äôt worsen into a season long injury‚Ä¶ (spoiler alert: his wrist did get better).

#### January 21st: The More Family the Better

The previous night, my aunt, Valerie, and uncle, Ryan, had driven out to Fernie from Alberta to spend some time with us. We would have an extended weekend with them. On Friday, all skiers, except for injured Will, set out for another day of skiing. It was a very pleasant day, devoid of major disasters, though my dad did briefly lose his new goggles. 

The day unwinded with another hot tub, Will teaching Mat and Nolan how to play Catan (Will won‚Ä¶) and take out pizza which was absolutely delicious - would recommend if I could remember the name of the place...

#### January 22nd: Leisurely Walks & Smoked Turkey

Saturday was a proper family day, rest in the morning, long walk in the afternoon, massif dinner in the evening. Catan was played again (Mat won this time). Our afternoon walk/hike in the afternoon was right in Penelope and Mat‚Äôs backyard. We brought toboggans in case we came across fun slopes. And fun was definitely had on the toboggans!

The large family dinner was a smoked turkey that spent all day in the smoker. It was incredibly delicious, flavorful and moist, with what I must admit were the best sides I‚Äôve ever had, lemon cauliflower rice and homemade caesar salad (both recipes we stole).

#### January 23rd: Last ski day

With the majority of the family (parents, aunt and uncle) on their way back home, Will and I stuck around one more day to ski with Penelope, Mat & Nolan. The conditions were definitely not the best, but we made the most of the day, had another tailgate lunch, an after ski hot tub and a leftover diner!

#### January 24th: Drive to Red Mountain

We had planned to leave on Monday morning to get to our next destination in Rossland, BC at a reasonable time (~4hours away), but it had been a week since Betty had complained and so she decided to throw us a fit. There we are ready to leave Fernie, finally get out of my cousin‚Äôs hair and our car won‚Äôt start, the battery seems dead. Thankfully for us, we were able to bug Mat who was working from home to diagnose our battery troubles, ensure it wasn‚Äôt our starter and give us a full new charge. 

{{< figure src="/img/Jan17-24/car_trouble.jpg" >}}
&nbsp;
> Mat & Penny, thank you so so much for your hospitality and help over our week in Fernie. We had the most incredible time. You are welcome in Toronto anytime (assuming we have an apartment by then ;p) 


#### Fernie Recommendations: 
* **Fernie Brewery** 
* **Distillery** - really fun cocktail bar, would recommend a drink with Fernie Fog (bought myself a bottle)
* **Lunch Box** - fresh wraps, salads and curries 
* **Funky Goat Pizza** - All pizzas were amazing but mushroom head is a must try!
* **Le Bon Pain** - Lovely french bakery with delicious sesame sourdough
