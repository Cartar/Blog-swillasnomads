## Post 29: Friends & Old Buildings

For the last two weeks of our trip we were back in English speaking territory. And by this point, we were losing ‚Äúexploring‚Äù steam. So our time in London (aug 17-19) was half spent at our airbnb and half out seeing friends and doing limited sightseeing.

&nbsp;

I should quickly say that a common theme in the UK were the strikes. While we were in London, staying 40 mins out of the downtown area, there was a transport strike for 3 out of our 5 days. So that was cool. 


### London Museums
On the one day we had with the tube running, we made it our mission to visit museums. After having visited the actual parthenon in Greece, we thought ‚Äúwhy not visit the best pieces of said parthenon that the English stole‚Äù. And it was wild. The British Museum has nicer pieces than the Acropolis museum in Athens. I definitely understand why Greece wants the pieces back. 

And then in the pouring rain, and I mean pouring, we made our way to the Natural History museum. We got to see Dippy, the little foot dinosaur and the skeleton of a blue whale which is always humbling.

### London Friends 

The real reason we were in London was to visit with friends, and they were all by far the highlight of London. 

We went out for drinks with Daniel, Will‚Äôs old highschool friend, and his partner Maggie. They brought us to an Irish Thai bar. Which seems like a really odd concept, but I loved it. It had the warmth and charm of an Irish bar with delicious Thai food. What‚Äôs not to like?

The next morning we stole Lili, a childhood best friend of mine, from her studies to meet us for coffee (well tea, but same difference). Lili, I hope you aced your thesis!

That night we met up with Dave, the Oxford man, for drinks and food at a never ending maze of food trucks, food stands and bars.

&nbsp;

The next day, on our last day, we were very generously gifted a musical by Will‚Äôs parents. I think they wanted us to grow more cultured, so we went to see The Book of Mormon, a musical comedy about religion. It was hilarious. We can not recommend it enough.

&nbsp;

Following the play we had a lovely time with Will‚Äôs friend Mark over a drink at a nearby pub (before they closed at 11pm and kicked us out).

If any of you are ever in Toronto - you must let us know! 

### Oxford 

On Saturday morning we headed to Oxford with Dave to get a tour of this exclusive, ancient campus.

&nbsp;

Dave, as our tour guide, explained that the campus is almost entirely owned by the colleges, a really odd system. There is almost no public land. 
>From the Oxford website: *‚ÄúOxford‚Äôs colleges are independent and self-governing, and relate to the University in a federal system like that of the United States.‚Äù* 

Which means that even with Dave‚Äôs student card, there were some colleges that wanted to make us pay to visit their very extensive grounds.

&nbsp;

We visited a few, but mostly we walked around, appreciated the architecture and attended an Oxford rowing race, accompanied by pints of Pimm‚Äôs cup. 
Which is definitely not a normal amount of Pimm‚Äôs.

&nbsp;

The drink hit hard.

&nbsp;

But it didn‚Äôt stop us from having a few more drinks throughout the day.

&nbsp;

Thank you so much Dave. We loved our day in Oxford. 

### York 

York is fabulous. However, the train ride to get there was anything but. We think it was due to the previous 4 days of strikes creating a huge pent up demand for the train. We had bought tickets for a specific train and when we went to board it was like being at a music festival, the crowds were insane. We were no longer sure we would even make the train. We ended up pushing our way in, but barely. Some passengers had bought seats on the train and couldn‚Äôt even make it to their seats. So we rode the 2.5hours journey standing in the aisle. But the cherry on top was the broken AC. It was so pleasant ü•µ.

&nbsp;

All that drama aside, we had a splendid day in York. The city has most of its medieval walls intact and you can walk their length, all 3.4kms of them. There is even a section of the wall which was built by the Romans around 71 AD. 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug17-23/york_wall.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Inside the city walls, is the massive York Minster (there has been a church on the site since 637 AD, but this current incarnation is newer - 13th century). 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug17-23/york_minister.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Just outside the city walls you can find St-Mary‚Äôs Abbey‚Äôs ruins, with its own surrounding walls for protection. The site is beautiful and free to visit, with of course, its own tumultuous history - I will leave you to google that on your own. The day would not be complete without a few drinks at various bars. One of said bars was a gate to the old walls (once called ‚Äúbars‚Äù). Maybe that‚Äôs the etymology of the word ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

When you find yourself bored of London the next time you visit, consider going to York.
