## Post 24: Biarritz with Family

The visit of old roommates continued a few days after Kaelan and Liam left with the arrival of my parents. 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/bayonne_parents.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

In the few days before my parents arrived, Will and I begged our airbnb host for a fan to brave the impending heat wave (35+ degrees heat we would experience for over 3 days), and mercifully, it arrived a day later. We successfully set it up (though didn't use all the screws) and it was essential in helping us sleep through the next few nights. I‚Äôll never take air conditioning for granted again. 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/fan.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

After days of heat, the apartment was impossible to cool down, I can remember my sweeping relief when the winds finally picked up and the temperature dropped to 27 degrees - it felt like winter.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the turn in temperature lasted quite a bit of time, corresponding with my parents‚Äô week in Biarritz. We went from wearing the bare minimum, to wearing fleeces and sleeping with duvets.

&nbsp;

### Rainy Days
My parents were good sports about the 4/7 rainy days they experienced. On those days, we rested, played some card games (being 4 allowed us to expand our game repertoire - welcome euchre!) and went for walks during breaks in the rain. Will was also finalizing his week long intensive french course! He‚Äôs now certified A2!

&nbsp;

Amidst the rain, I was still able to show my parents the coastal landmarks. This included the climb up the gazillion steps up the phare (lighthouse) lookout for the second time in 2 weeks.

&nbsp;

We also made it to my favourite bar a couple times, but both times we were rained out and forced home.

&nbsp;

Once we had gotten my mom a wet suit we were able to follow Will‚Äôs lead and go swimming in the rain.

&nbsp;

It was so much fun to enjoy the stormy ocean without being cold. We‚Äôre definitely getting our money‚Äôs worth out of our suits.

&nbsp;

Bayonne provided the perfect rainy getaway, a 30 minute bus ride away, we revisited the old medieval downtown, quickly touring the church and settling in for a quick drink before heading back to Biarritz.

### Sunny Days

&nbsp;

Any chance we got we would eat outside, making full use of the balcony - we did get some pretty spectacular sunsets. 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/sunset.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

And we were smart. On the two expected sunny days we planned our day trips. 

#### Vespa Day! 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/stj_will_me.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

If you‚Äôve been reading all my long blog posts you‚Äôll know how much I love vespas, especially here. So we had to recreate the vespa day with my parents. 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/scooter_3.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

I think it‚Äôs safe to say we all had an incredible day, everyone had a smile plastered on their faces from the ride. 

We stopped again in Bidart for lunch, trying out a multitude of basque style tapas. We definitely ordered too much, but thankfully Will and my dad seem to be bottomless pits (at least for bread and meat). 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/bidart_food.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

St-Jean de Luz was everything we remembered it to be, we spent a good amount of time at the beach. Most of us went for a swim (my mom thought the water was too cold). Will and I practiced our dives off the floating docks once more, it was by no means pretty, but was it ever fun. 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/stj_parents.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

That day, Saint-Jean de Luz was teaming with people, all gathered to celebrate La Saint-Jean Baptiste on June 24th (felt like we were back in Montreal, except for all the basque colours, and massive parade).

&nbsp;

#### Spain Day! 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/san_seb_selfie.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Biarritz is located 35km from the Spanish border. Yet, we hadn‚Äôt been to visit the nearest city, Donostia-San Sebastian, until my parents came around and organized it. Sometimes you just need parental guidance. 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/san_seb_by_sea.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Though I don‚Äôt recommend Blah Blah bus to anyone (we arrived over 2 hours later than scheduled), the city of San Sebastian is beautiful and surprisingly massive. We spent most of our time in the old town, characterized by it‚Äôs small medieval streets and abundance of pintxos restaurants (tapas). 

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/san_seb_walking.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

The pintxos were part of our mission while visiting, we wanted to try a bunch. And though some of them were delicious, by and large they were incredibly salty and vegetables were impossible to find. We actually went by a fruit vendor after lunch to buy some produce because our systems were so oversalted and over meated. But hey, we tried it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

{{< figure src="/img/June17-28/san_seb_will.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

The city is also flanked by two massive beaches. And given we actually had nice weather that day, we all went for a very refreshing swim (we weren't the only ones with that idea).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Mom and dad if you‚Äôre reading this (which you better be), Will and I are so happy you came to visit. The memories will not soon be forgotten and we‚Äôll be forever grateful for all the wonderful meals and drinks you treated us to. Merci beaucoup!
