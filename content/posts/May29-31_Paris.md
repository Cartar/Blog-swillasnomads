## Post 21: Jetlag in Paris


After almost 2 months in Australia and New Zealand, it was time to venture back somewhat closer to home. On May 28th, we were officially entering Phase 3 of our sabbatical: Biarritz and Europe.

&nbsp;

It started off with the longest travel day I’ve ever experienced. We left Auckland at 8pm on May 28th, and flew a redeye to San Francisco (12hrs flight), before taking yet another redeye to Paris (11hrs flight). Following two back to back nights, we were understandably a little messed up arriving in Paris on the 29th. But we were determined to make the most of it.

Our first order of business is always getting new SIM cards. So far we had had no issues picking up a cheap package at airports in both Australia and NZ. But the french don’t want to make it easy on you. There is no telecom service provider located at the international terminal, I read online that terminal 3 (domestic), is the place to go. We set out for terminal 3, only to realize it’s closed. We decide to make our way to a mall near our airbnb to pick up SIM cards, which would normally be a short train ride away, but given it was a Sunday, and there was track work, we had to trek back across the airport to catch a shuttle bus. 

Long story short, we make it to the mall with our big luggage, both get new french numbers and way too much data (120 GB, for €20/month!), and make our way to our Parisien private room.

We have enough energy to walk to Montmartre before grabbing food and pulling the curtains shut at 8pm.

We have two full days in Paris before flying to Biarritz. Both days are started with a delicious spread of patisseries Will gets at a nearby bakery (4 different items for under €5, we’re going to love it here).

&nbsp;

Our first day we rent bikes, and go on a site seeing tour of many majour parisian monuments (of which there are many). We tour the Louvre gardens, Notre Dame, the Opera House, the free view point on top of Galerie Lafayette, l’Arc de Triomphe and the Tour Eiffel (where we also have a wonderful picnic).

On day two, we read by the seine, grab lunch with an old friend, Matias, at a great dumpling house (after cancelling on him for dinner the night before because we both fell asleep before 7pm...) and catch the last set of Fernandez in the French Open on the free rooftop.

We’re meant to go tour the Louvre in the afternoon, but just like our Met experience, it’s closed on Tuesdays. We decide to go to the Catacombs, and that too is out of reach due to poor planning (tickets are all sold out). So we spent our afternoon in the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens.

Paris is always so lovely, but I was definitely antsy to get to Biarritz. Get to a spot where we wouldn’t be moving around every few days. And boy oh boy, did it live up to my expectations! Biarritz in the next post!
