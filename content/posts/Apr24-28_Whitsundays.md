## Post 14: Rain or Shine

We made the decision to head up to the Whitsundays even though the forecast called for rain. We figured if we had a nice airbnb with a view, it would still be nice to relax in warm rainy weather. And I was very much looking forward to the plan being ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. Will and I have learned that if you don‚Äôt plan for explicit relaxation/chill days, then you don‚Äôt get them. Granted, days get filled up with epic adventures, but sometimes we have to force ourselves to recharge (or at least I certainly do, Will goes along with it).

Turns out our decision was the right one. We had 2 days of rain where we caught up on blog posts (we‚Äôre behind again), and relaxed by swimming in the rain and reading. Our last two days were epic boat trips. 

I‚Äôll fast forward to the boat trips, cause we have the most pictures and because I remember them best. 

### Sailing Day - April 27

This particular boat had been unable to go out for a week due to the storm winds the islands had been subject to, but luck was on our side and we sailed out on a beautiful sunny day (more than one person burnt on our trip).

The trip was insanely peaceful. We were sailing on a BYOB catamaran that slowly moved through the beauty of the whitsundays.

We made two stops, one on a nature reserve island to walk around and another snorkeling spot (where we saw the largest sea clam I have ever seen - over a meter in length. It should make an appearance in the video compilation of this trip). 

We would recommend the trip.

### Speed Boating - April 28

This day was epic, but definitely less relaxing. We were warned about sitting at the front of the boat, but we did so anyway. The trip was akin to a splash zone rollercoaster. So exhilarating at the beginning and feared by the end of the trip while you‚Äôre shivering on board and all your stuff is wet. Footage of that to come. 

However, the speed of the boat allowed us to fit in two snorkel spots and a mandatory trip to Whitehaven beach; the most picturesque beach. The sand swirls in turquoise water and the shallow waters house manta rays and lemon sharks both of which you can see by wading out into the water. The reef that wasn‚Äôt damaged by the cyclone in 2013 was spectacular (I‚Äôm running out of positive adjectives here), and the fish gigantic.

It was a wonderful way to close our chapter of warmth in Australia, our next stops would bring us south in progressively colder places.

This area of Australia is a must visit if you‚Äôre going to make the trip. 


#### Observations
* If you expect rain the whole time, clouds make you so happy. 
* We thought we would be able to see the great barrier reef from the whitsundays, but not many companies go all the way out to the reef (it‚Äôs quite far), best place to see it is from Cairns, where it‚Äôs closest to shore. 
* Snorkeling tours include stinger suits but not flippers ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* Restaurants in town (Airlie Beach) were okay, but we preferred eating our own food
* If you plan on doing an overnight sailing trip, I would consider both weather and size of beds (they definitely would not have fit a Will). 


#### Recommendations
* Free sausage sizzle (what Aussies call hot dogs) in front of the liquor store on Thursdays (don‚Äôt ask question just eat it!). 
* A sailing excursion & one that will take you to Whitehaven Beach
