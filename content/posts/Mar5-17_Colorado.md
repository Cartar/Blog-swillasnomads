# Post 10: Converging in Colorado

We wrapped up the ski season in Colorado, with 4 final mountains: Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone and a little known resort called Vail. 
{{< figure src="/img/Mar5-17/will_jump.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Fun fact which I learned on this trip, after finding out that one of the founders of Vail (Peter Seibert) was a veteran of the 10th Mountain Division, who fought in Italy during WWII, is that downhill skiing owes its origin in large part to military endeavours (a way to get around more easily in cold mountainous regions). Another thing we enjoy with roots in the military - ainâ€™t that always the way? 



### Colorado Part 1: Exploring on our own 

{{< figure src="/img/Mar5-17/look_ma.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Before we were to be joined in Colorado by our friends, Emika and Yannis, Will and I had 4 days to explore this region on our own. Attempting to let ourselves rest a bit, we took the first day, Sunday March 6th, off of skiing. We were meant to unwind in our airbnb, and maybe get some laundry done. However, the day quickly got away from us, from going to 3 places to find enough quarters to do laundry, to preparing a chili for later in the week (my family chili recipe requires an afternoon at home to properly let the flavours simmer) and doing some much needed trip planning, we, or atleast I, didnâ€™t feel fully unwound. 

But alas, onwards and upwards. Monday we hit up Beaver Creek, Tuesday we visited Vail followed by Breckenridge on Wednesday. And honestly the resorts all sort of blurred for me in those first days.

&nbsp;

Few things I can comment on / remember: 
* Parking is never free. Will and I started understanding why people say Vail is for the rich. A commentator on reddit summarized it best: 
> There's a formula for this:
 Free â‰  Vail
* Vail is very large, which translates to a lot of polling between sections of the mountain.
* Beaver Creek had mostly okay terrain, with a really fun black diamond section way up on the mountain that had the best snow and all runs were named after birds. 
* Breckenridge also had large diversity of terrain, but the highest peaks werenâ€™t really accessible since the winds were so strong they were creating white-out conditions. Our solution - head into the trees. 
    > * Side story: We took a double black diamond down through the trees thinking we would find the most snow there. With my confidence growing with every day on snow I followed Will. Things were going well up until they werenâ€™t. My ski fell off coming off a turn over a large mogul (my dins were too low), and I fell awkwardly on my right arm. I felt my shoulder try and come out of its socket. It is sore to this day. 
    > * Mostly I felt anger that my ski had come off. The fall, for once, didnâ€™t actually feel like it was my fault, like I could have done something different. After a brief pause, we made it down and found me some advil.
    > * For those of you curious, the run was called Windows, off E-chair. Let me know if you ever venture on it ! 

### Colorado Part 2: Friends from Montreal

{{< figure src="/img/Mar5-17/group_selfie2.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Will and I were so excited to have our two close friends from Montreal join us for some skiing in Colorado! Iâ€™ve known Emika since I was 6 (we met at our neighbourhood street party - yes, I know, super cute), and even though we grew up together, babysitting neighbours, playing soccer and volleyball together even attending the same university we had only ever skied together once, in highschool, at Tremblant and neither of us remember it very well. So this felt new for us. 

Will and I didnâ€™t know the level of comfortability to expect from our two new ski partners, who had both bought new equipment for this trip. However, we quickly realized they were up for *any* and *all* runs. 

{{< figure src="/img/Mar5-17/will_emika_hill.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Yannis often throwing himself down runs first, tired of us debating if we should or shouldnâ€™t go down at the top. Glades became a group favourite, even though the newly purchased skis were mainly meant for groomed runs. 

Yes, there were some falls. 

Yes, there was some tree hugging. 

No, no one got seriously injured.

{{< figure src="/img/Mar5-17/emika_snow.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

I want to thank both of them for the many laughs, the positivity as we froze at Breck (Iâ€™m pretty sure Willâ€™s nose was frost bitten), the handmade bucket hats, the demonstration of true athleticism and the willingness to run through some ski drills at Keystone (mainly you Yannis ðŸ˜œ), and especially for introducing us to so many Trader Joe wonders. Oh and I guess for Willâ€™s sake, Iâ€™ll mention his gratitude that you agreed to play so many boardgames with us ðŸ˜‚.  

We can not wait to come visit you both in MontrÃ©al.

### Colorado Part 3: Family in Vail 

As soon as Emika and Yannis were gone, we were joined in Colorado by Willâ€™s parents, Andrea and Erik. We took one day off skiing before finishing our time in Colorado with 3 days at Vail. 

{{< figure src="/img/Mar5-17/will_family.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Andrea had been to Vail quite a few times growing up and was able to show us some of her favourite runs and those she remembers fondly. From Blue Ox, to Riva Ridge, to Highline (apparently the hardest run at Vail - essentially a long double black run that is filled with moguls. Itâ€™s a leg killer.). All runs Will and I hadn't yet done.

&nbsp;

Honestly, keeping up with Andrea was really difficult at times, even though she will deny it, I see where Will gets his speed. Though admittedly, Andreaâ€™s ski style is way more controlled than her sonâ€™s.

&nbsp;

Erik joined us for the best two days out of the three we were skiing. One beautiful blue sky day and one incredibly snowy day. Though he might not agree that both days were good, since that snowy day turned greens into blues and blacks into blues. I.e. more snow makes normally groomed greens more challenging, but steep black runs more forgiving. Even though conditions werenâ€™t ideal for Erik, we still thank him for staying out with us and letting us all lap some heavy powder runs!

&nbsp;

We took the opportunity with Willâ€™s parents to explore Vail village, get some ice cream, buy a postcard and enjoy a few meals out - thank you both again so much. I would also be remiss if I didnâ€™t mention and thank you for the two large blocks of cheese you left with us, which we are still eating to this day!
