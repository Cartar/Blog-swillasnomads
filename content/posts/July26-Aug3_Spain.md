## Post 26: A visit with Diplomats  

Our time in France is over, which means Will and I have to double our efforts to continue working on his French but also that new adventures can begin. Some would say we had gotten too comfortable in Biarritz. A shake up was in order.

&nbsp;

### Heading south

We really wanted more heat. Constant days of over 30, with no chance of rain, so we headed to M√°laga. And Spain delivered. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details of our long travel day to M√°laga and just say that it involved 3 buses, a flight and 2 more buses üöé ‚úàÔ∏è üöå (our travel clothes desperately needed a wash after that day). 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_travel_day.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We were only in M√°laga for one full day before we were to venture to San Pablo to visit Ingrid and Bruce (Will‚Äôs aunt and uncle). 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_colours.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We spent most of that time in the old city with a notable exception for lunch, where we ventured 30mins outside of the city to eat paella (the best rated restaurant Will could find that was open on a Wednesday) and drink cava in honour of Will‚Äôs birthday. We were far enough outside the tourist district that no one really spoke english in the restaurant, and so we‚Äôre unsure why at the end of our meal the waiter gave us both a free digestif but no complaints here - it was the cherry on top of a delicious meal.

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_paella.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We should have gone into a siesta after that lunch, but it was not to be. We had places to be, paintings to see. 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_picasso.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We walked around the old town, visited the Picasso museum, had yet another drink on a terrasse to cool down (and got another drink for free for unknown reasons) and had churros from Casa Aranda, established in 1932. 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/malaga_drinks.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

This may be an ignorant thing to write, but churros aren‚Äôt meant to be sweet. Even the chocolate dipping sauce wasn‚Äôt sweet. Actually an overall observation from Europe so far is that desserts aren‚Äôt sickly sweet, that‚Äôs a North American thing‚Ä¶

### El Diplomatico Feo (EDF)

On July 28th, we traveled by bus to San Roque, roughly 3 hours west of M√°laga, where we were picked up by Ingrid and driven 50 mins inland to San Pablo. 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/map.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;


Just outside of San Pablo, Ingrid and Bruce (ex-diplomats) have the most wonderful BnB in the Spanish countryside (not a fake airbnb, but a real bed and breakfast, where every morning a feast is laid out for their guests). 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/all4.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

And though the weather continued to be punishing, Will and I had a wonderful time - how could we not? The property is stunning, dinner conversations with our hosts were always incredibly engaging, taking us well into the night and the hospitality Ingrid and Bruce showed two leeches such as ourselves was unparalleled and very generous. 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/EDF_outside.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

A big thank you for welcoming us into your home and sharing your knowledge and stories from your remarkable lives, we‚Äôd love to come back one day (maybe in the spring this time ü•µ).

### Highlights from the south of spain

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/ingrid_cave.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

#### Cueva de la Pileta & Ronda 

On our first full day at EDF, Ingrid took us to the two places we most wanted to visit in the region. We had been told by multiple people that we had to visit the Cueva de la Pileta and Ronda. 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/cave_outside.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

The caves were a trip highlight. In my opinion the best way to interact with history (so much better than a museum). The Pileta Cave system, discovered in 1905, spans multiple kilometers and is filled with art and artifacts of prehistoric humans. The caves are filled with smoke residue from multiple fires over millennia, humans from the neolithic period (10k-5k years ago) left calendars on the walls believed to track the lunar cycle and pieces of clay pottery. The earliest paintings were carbon dated to 40 thousand years ago (a relatively new discovery, the last time Ingrid had been to the caves the paintings were estimated to be ~30 thousand years old).

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, we were not allowed photography in the caves. I guess it means you‚Äôll have to plan your own trip to la Cueva de la Pileta (or cheat by checking out the [website](https://cuevadelapileta.es/page/visita/))! 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/bridge_will.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Ronda, our second stop of the day, is a beautiful city known for its imposing bridge (Puente Nuevo) completed in 1793 and its bullfighting ring. We were mostly there to see the bridge. My favourite piece of trivia is that the small window above the main arch once served as a prison.

&nbsp;

#### Too hot to move 

For the remainder of our stay at EDF we mainly laid low and kept to the shade. 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/will_inside.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We made great use of the pool and of the nearby river, where the water is slightly more refreshing, and little fishies pick at your dead skin (can‚Äôt say I ever got used to the feeling). 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/river_us.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Ingrid and Bruce treated us to the most wonderful meals, for which we owe them a home cooked meal when they eventually come to Toronto.

#### Castle

The last area we explored was Jimena, a historic town part of the Pueblos Blancos (white villages). 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/castle_view_ingrid.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

It has a tumultuous history of multiple occupants, from the Iberian and Phoenician, to the Romans and the Moors. All their influences can be felt to this day, and nowhere is it more beautiful to witness than atop the castle (which is free to visit!). 

{{< figure src="/img/July26-Aug3/castle_will_ingrid.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

A massive thank you to Ingrid for being our historic guide through the city (and really the whole region). You satiated our curiosity and then some!
