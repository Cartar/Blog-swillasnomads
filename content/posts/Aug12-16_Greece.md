## Post 28: Great Food, Better Company 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug12-16/will_tommy_flag.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

Our time in Greece flew by. Will and I didnâ€™t quite know what to expect because we lazily allowed our host to plan out our whole itinerary. And for that and so much more we are so thankful to Tommy, who planned out a really special sÃ©jours in Athens and accompanying cities for us. But before diving into the details, we need to thank our gracious hosts, Bill and Mary, for so warmly welcoming us into their home.

&nbsp;

We had 5 nights scheduled in Athens, but upon landing Tommy suggested we go to the Peloponnese for 2 of those nights. He said (rightly so), that you donâ€™t need more than a day to visit Athens - and so why not get an incredibly unique experience?

&nbsp;

While exploring the region, we would be staying in Billâ€™s childhood village, Sagkas. Once a thriving village with its own school (granted Bill states there were only two teachers, grades 1-3 on the first floor and 4-6 on the second floor) is now much reduced in size. The last bar didnâ€™t survive the pandemic. Nevertheless, Will and I loved our time in Sagkas. It is oddly peaceful, being so secluded while also being able to hear next door neighbours extremely clearly. And the mountainous scenery is so lovely to wake up to. Iâ€™d highly recommend it, though the village has no hotelâ€¦

&nbsp;

However, visiting larger nearby cities would be feasible for all tourists. Mainly, Nafplion and Dimitsana.

&nbsp;

Nafplion had stunning sea side views, and a famous hike up a thousand steps (really only 857 says google) to the Fortress of Palamidi, built by the venetians.

&nbsp;

Though we never completed the journey up the mountain, I needed to have fresh legs for our hike the next day in Dimitsana. And what a hike it was.

&nbsp;


We didnâ€™t really know what we were getting ourselves into since this was also uncharted territory for Tommy but we were all quite pleasantly surprised. The hike along the valley is beautiful, and mercifully mostly shaded from the very hot sun. Better than the shade are the monasteries. 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug12-16/will_tommy_hike.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

One in particular (monastery of Philosophos), is so well hidden in the rock, we almost missed it. Turns out it was built during the Ottoman occupation to continue teaching young greek boys. It is built into the cliff itself. A wild engineering feat. 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug12-16/hidden_monastery.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

An argument could potentially be made that it is not structurally sound anymore, but who am I to say? Iâ€™m not an engineer. 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug12-16/structure_monestary.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

And I was extremely glad to be able to walk through the ruins. 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug12-16/will_sam_monastery.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

We could have kept going on the hike to yet another cliffside monastery, but our will was ebbing and we decided seeing it from afar was good enough. Tommy has to complete the whole thing one day and tell us how it is.

&nbsp;

I also want to quickly mention that we had some lovely swims in Greece, but never brought our phones with us. The water was so clear and warm, definitely no more need for a wetsuit. The only downside was Will getting stung by a jellyfish ðŸ˜£â€¦

&nbsp;

Amongst all the incredible things we saw in Greece, spending time with Tommy and his family was the best. It probably didnâ€™t hurt that there always seemed to be the most incredible food associated with the gatherings. 

{{< figure src="/img/Aug12-16/family_lunch.jpg" >}} 
&nbsp;

The conversations flowed and so did the wine (well mostly beer). What more could you ask for? Great food and even better company - Yamas!

The post wouldnâ€™t be complete without a bunch of pictures of ruins youâ€™ve seen depicted so many times throughout your life - the Acropolis. So here goes:

{{< carousel title="" >}}
&nbsp;

What I will share is our favourite fact we learned with our free online audio guide. The parthenon was constructed with optical illusion tricks to make it seem perfectly straight and grand. All the pillars are leaning towards each other, if you drew out a straight line they would eventually touch. The pillars in the corners are larger than the rest, and they all bulge imperceptibly in the middle to give the illusion of grandeur. There is no straight line in the Parthenon ðŸ¤¯! Every section of each pillar is cut to measure, not one is the same as the other - Perfectionism to the nth degree.

Oh and shout out to our first class experience while flying to Greece. It was sublime. And will most likely never happen again.
