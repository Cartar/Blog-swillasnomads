# Post 1: The Drive Out to BC

On January 4th, Will and I completed our last day of paid work for the better part of 2022. The sabbatical (aka mini retirement) that we had been planning pretty much since our first date (in October of 2017) was finally becoming a reality. The original plan was to leave on January 5th at night and drive up to Bracebridge, followed by a 13h drive to Thunderbay the next day. However, trying to embrace fluidity and uncertainty during our COVID travels, we realized while packing our belongings for a 3 month ski trip and leaving our remaining belongings somewhat well organized in Will‚Äôs parents house would require an additional day. The new plan became (weather and covid permitting): 

* **Day 1**: Toronto to Sault St-Marie, 7h drive
* **Day 2**: Sault St-Marie to Thunderbay, 7h45 drive
* **Day 3**: Thunderbay to Winnipeg, 7h45 drive
* **Day 4**: Winnipeg to Regina, 5h45 drive
* **Day 5**: Regina to Golden, BC (first week long stop), 10h10 drive


### Here is a not so short recap!

{{< figure src="/img/Jan6-10/packed_car.jpg" >}}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Day 1: üöô Sault St-Marie, ON

**Highlights:**
* A quick stop in Uxbridge to visit our friends and new home owners Hill and Riggs (thank you for the delicous breaky sandies!).
* A lunch stop at one of the last remaining Lick‚Äôs burgers in Ontario, a real nostalgic throwback.  
* Listening to Harry Potter on audiobook!!

**Tips:**  
* Toronto winter are fake compared to western Ontario and the Prairies, getting a block heater was key in feeling that our car, Betty Bishu (a 2014 Mitsubishi RVR), would start (temperature in Sault overnight was -30 degrees). 

## Day 2: üöô Thunder Bay, ON

**Highlights:**
* Old Woman Bay, an absolutely stunning winter wonderland, right off the highway and right on Lake Superior:

&nbsp;
* Wawa Goose, was a must on Will‚Äôs list and for good reason. This goose is extremely cool, which is something I never thought I would say about a Canadian goose, since they are normally scary and leaving their poop everywhere for you to step in. But a large sculpture of a flying goose, is a sight to be seen. It also allowed us to learn about the completion of the Trans Canadian Highway, the town of Wawa had to fight with politician to get the highway to go by their town, but due to the ancient Precambrian rock of the area, the area was deemed impassable and became known as ‚ÄúThe Gap‚Äù for a long time. The highway was not completed until 1960. Prior to that they either ysed steamboats on Lake Superior to get around, or rails post 1921. [You can learn more here!](https://www.wawa.cc/en/things-to-do/trans-canada-highway-and-the-wawa-goose.aspx#Trans-Canada-highway)).

&nbsp;
* Red Rock, ON. A highlight for me, though most likely not a necessary stop for others, as this town would be accurately described as a ghost town, however, for me it represented the childhood home of my paternal grandfather (sometime between the years of 1941 - 1953). This now sleepy town was once thriving due to the industry of pulp and paper, though the mill closed in 2006. If by chance you are interested you can learn more [here](http://www.redrocktownship.com/community/history/street-scenes/) 
* Terry Fox Monument. The place where Terry Fox had to end his run across Canada because his cancer came back. The monument is beautiful and worth a small detour from the highway. And on a non-cloudy day I‚Äôm sure you could see the sleeping giant in the distance.

&nbsp;

**Tips:** 
* This section of the drive was probably the most scenic of our 5 days. Make sure you take some time to stop along the way and enjoy the beauty of western Ontario. 
* Eating out eats at your budget (pun intended). We started stopping at grocery stores in the morning to get cheese and crackers or remade salads for our lunches and even microwave meals for our dinners. 

## Day 3: üöô Winnipeg, MB


**Highlights:** 
* 3hrs into our 8hr drive we come to a complete stop on the highway. A road worker tells us the highway is closed‚Ä¶ the only highway that can take us to Winnipeg. And for the last hour and a half we have come across no sign of life, let alone an open motel, turning back now would be a huge set back. The car in front of us completes a U-turn, we move up a bit to see what‚Äôs going on and see an OPP officer approach, Will gets out of the car to talk to him. It goes something like this: 

> Will: Hey officer, what‚Äôs going on? 
> 
> OPP: the highway is closed due to too many accidents, didn‚Äôt you see the sign? 
> 
> Will: No‚Ä¶ (looking confused, truthfully we hadn‚Äôt seen a sign), we must have missed it. We‚Äôre trying to get to Winnipeg, is there another way
> 
> OPP: You have to go west
> 
> Will: Through this highway? 
> 
> OPP: Yes
> 
> Will: So, can we go through? 
> 
> OPP: Yes if you drive carefully 
> 
> Will: Yes of course, we will be incredibly careful. Thank you so much! 

And with that we proceeded past the first accident onto an empty highway to make it to Winnipeg on schedule. We have never felt more grateful in our lives, it was almost enough to turn us religious. As we excited the closed portion of the highway after not seeing that many crazy accidents, we see a line of what must have been 50 18 wheelers at a complete dead stop because the two lane highway was closed and they had no way to turn around and they also couldn‚Äôt keep going. Our feeling of relief only grew at the sight.

* Winnipeg. I must admit, prior to visiting this province, I had judged it, assuming there was nothing there. We both did. And we were proved wrong. Winnipeg is a beautiful city though extremely cold (I had never experienced -40 degrees before‚Ä¶). It has a charming downtown, with a union station and Fairmount hotel that remind you that the city expanded with the railroad at the same time as Quebec City and other prominent Canadian cities. By recommendation we stopped at the Forks for food and skating, it‚Äôs a large indoor market with restaurants, drinks and artisanal buys. Would highly recommend the Sri Lanken restaurant and specifically their house Roti. As for skating, don‚Äôt be fooled by the small skating rink at the front, the complex has paths of skating and a frozen river that in my opinion could rival the canal in Ottawa. Though the temperatures were freezing, we bundled up and skated with a drink and beavertail in hand.

* Visiting Flin Flon Manitoba is now on our bucket list.

**Observations:** 
Crossing Ontario takes 10 years, crossing the prairies is really short 

## Day 4: üöô Regina, SK

**Highlights:** 
* Will‚Äôs maternal grandparents are high school sweethearts that  grew up in Regina, within a 10min walk of each other. So naturally we had to drive by and visit both their childhood houses. We tried to FaceTime them during this drive by, but they were unable to take our call, so we had to opt for some video footage.

&nbsp;
**Tips:** 
* Don‚Äôt stop in Regina unless you have a familial reason to do so. Only driving 6hours in a day leaves the last day with 10hours instead of 8hours across the board and we did not find Regina as pleasant a city as Winnipeg. We wanted to at least visit the site of where Louis Riel was hung but the site was closed‚Ä¶.

## Day 5: üöô Golden, BC

**Highlights:** 
* Seeing Will‚Äôs aunt and uncle for a mini hike just outside of Calgary in the beginning of Banff National Park. Getting a break to stretch our legs with the beautiful rockies as our backdrop was incredible. Not to mention seeing family that lives on the other side of the country is always a privilege.

&nbsp;
* Having the car break down on us once we had arrived at our final destination where we would be spending at least a week instead of on a narrow highway in the rockies at night. Though of course that came with the challenges of finding a garage that could see us the next day and hopefully identify what was wrong with our car. More on that in our next post!

**Observations:** 
* Being much further north in the winter means less daylight, we left Regina at 7h30 in the morning and it was complete darkness. We didn‚Äôt see the sun until closer to 9am ‚Ä¶
