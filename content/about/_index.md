Weâ€™re a couple from Ontario, Canada. Will is a Toronto boy born and raised, and I'm a bilingual gal from Ottawa who somewhat reluctantly ended up in Toronto for work. We met at Capital One Canada, in Toronto as we were both starting our new jobs within a month of each other. Pretty much from our first date we discussed, over beers and ping pong, that we both wanted to eventually leave these new jobs, and travel, a sabbatical of sorts, minus the research component. I expressed my desire to move to Biarritz, France to live and surf. Will wanted to buy a school bus, renovate it into a home and ski and hike his way across North America. 

Over the next few years our compromised plan came to fruition, we would ski the winter in North America, travel to Australia and New Zealand in the spring and spend our summer in Europe (a good chunk spent in Biarritz). After pointing out that I enjoyed regular showers as I travelled, and realizing how expensive renovating a van would be, we opted for using a car and staying in airbnbs and hotels (well, motels).

And so this site is our digital journal of our adventures. We hope our family, friends and curious strangers will enjoy tagging along with us. 

Regards, 

Nomads for now
